Why do we need comments? 

A comment is a special construct in a programming language tht allows developer to mention additional information associated with the program. 

Improves portability and maintainability of code

<b>Comments</b>

Single line comments are made with two (//) forward slashes : // Comments 

Multi line comments: */ Comments */

JARGON

assign: when you give a variable a value
access: obtaining values from a data typ4
log: use the method console.log (* place what you want to see here*)

VARIABLES

a named container for data
- the var keyword declares a new variable with the given name
- can be assigned a value using the = operators
- only need to be declared once
- referencing the name of the variable will return the value it contains 

VARIABLES EXAMPLES

var lastName; // <-- Declaring a variable
lastName = 'Robinson'; // <-- Assigning a variable 
lastName = 'Connor'; // <-- Re-assigning a variable 

STRINGS 
- A collection of characters / symbols surrounded by quote i.e ( ' ' or " ")
- We can access individual characters in a string with bracket notation 
- Can be combined using the + operator
- Have a length property that returns the total number of characters the string contains  (.length) 

STRING EXAMPLES 

var myVar; // <-- Declaring a variable
myVar = 'Robinson'; // <-- String made with single quotes (')
mrVar = "Robinson"; // <-- string made with double quotes (") 

NUMBERS
- Any numerical value: positive, negative, or with decimal points
- Like regular numbers, we can add, subtract, divide and multiply;
- And new values can be created with arithmetic expressions;

NUMBER EXAMPLEs
 
var myNum = 5; // Regular number
myNum = 1.5; // Decimal Number
myNum = 4 + 5; // Mathematical Expressions 

BOOLEANS
- a true or false value
- you can almost think of them similar to on/off switch
- typically used in conditional statement
- can be created with boolean expressions using comparison operators 

BOOLEAN EXAMPLES 

var myBool = true; // Boolean value
var myBool = false; // Boolean value
myBool = 1 === 1; // Comparison 

USING CONSOLE LOG
- a way for us as developers to physically see data
- shows as plain text in our console
- console is just an object for us to use with different methods built in

> green is what is being returned / white is console <

CONSOLE LOG EXAMPLES

var name = 'Andy'; // <-- variable
console.log(name); // <-- this will log 'andy' to the console 

DEFINITIONS 

- Variable = can be thought of as named containers. You can place data into these containers and thenrefer to the data simply by naming the container.
- String = is a sequence of characters enclosed with quotes
- Number = is just that, a number or numerical value you can work with
- Boolean = is value based on true or false values
