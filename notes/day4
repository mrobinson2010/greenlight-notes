LOOPS

LOOPING
- iterate: to perform or utter repeatedly
- why is this construct important: so we can perform an action a specific number of times
- 3 main loops:
while loops
for loops
for-in loops

JARGON
- start condition: the condition set to tell your loop where to begin
- stopping condition: the condition set to tell your loop when to stop (based on boolean value)
- increment: how much we will move per iteration

EXAMPLES
for (var i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
console.log('Hello');
}

EXAMPLES
for (var key in object) {
console.log(key);
console.log(onject[key]);
} 

var object = {
  firstName: 'Justin',
  lastName: 'Connor',
  homeTown: 'Loray'
  }
  
  var count = 0;
    while (count < 5) {
      console.log(count);
        count++;
  };
